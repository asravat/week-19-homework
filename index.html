                   <h1>I Design for a Better World</h1>
                   <p>I’m a UX & UI designer, creative thinker with the ability to deliver design solutions combining research, data analysis, sketching, and prototyping. From pencil to digital Hi-Fi, with careful attention to details, I'm driven to make the world better!felt the need to bring more value to people. I decided to go beyond the visual aspect of creation.  I like growing and gaining new skills on my journey. That is why I moved forward to improving others' lives with UX.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I work at the intersection of social welfare and user experience design. I've engaged in helping with epidemiology research studies to teaching and learning dance to training the community on disaster preparedness all while pursuing my passion for UI and UX design. Every step of the way, I've wanted to make people feel better through the power of interactive harmony.</p>
                <p>Yes, I care about how people feel! I've always been an empathic person, someone who is able to step into others’ shoes and understand their emotions. This helps me in the UX field to conduct effective research and create user-centered products. I always strive to find balanced solutions for everyone: business, users, and developers.</p>
                <p>People say I’m a designer with a coordinated mindset. Indian-born, I moved to the US in 1999 where I had to start everything from scratch. Facing challenges along the way, I learnt to get out of my comfort zone and pursue a career in design.</p>
                <p>Still looking ahead, I felt the need to bring more value to people. I decided to go beyond the visual aspect of creation.  I like growing and gaining new skills on my journey. That is why I moved forward to improving others' lives with UX.</p>
